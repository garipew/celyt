# Celyt
Celyt is a time machine going one second per second into the future!

Send an email to your future self with celyt, a time capsule made with springboot.

## Run it locally!
To run Celyt locally, ensure you have java (17 minimum) installed and run:
```
gradle bootRun
```

## This is a learning MVP
Celyt was made with the intention of getting familiar with some aspects of springboot, not to be a production-ready app.

In this project I tackle:
- Springboot project structure;
- Request mapping;
- Configuring and using a DB;
- Scheduling Tasks.
